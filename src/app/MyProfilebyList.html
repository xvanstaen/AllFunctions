<text>My executive career spans over 37 years, with in-depth expertise in 3 main roles: 
<ul>
<li> Product & Soliution Management,
<li> Program,
<li> Delivery Management.
<br>
<text>These interrelated positions gave me hands-on experience in all areas of our business:
<ul>
<li>to adapt to the fluid changes (internal and external) of the Travel Industry, which is both competitive and innovative,
<li>to coach people. It gave me great satisfaction to help many senior managers evolve,
<li>to participate in Industry events and
<li>to use new methodologies over the years (the latest one being SAFE).
<br>
<text>As VP Product Management based in Nice, I defined products/solutions 
<style=font-style:italic;>(e.g. design, positioning, pricing, business cases, contracts) 
<text>in cooperation with numerous teams in our organization (a product/solution is never defined by one team only!). I managed customers in North-America, Europe and Asia-Pacific, from pre-sales to implementation, managed customer forums, and led a large team responsible for the entire Airline IT Product portfolio (Reservation, Inventory, Departure Control).
<br>
<text>As Program Director based in Seoul, I successfully implemented, within a 3 year-period, a large program which required an effort of circa 700 man-years of development and implementation. This program has contributed to the success of our Airline IT and Distribution business units in APAC.
<br>
<text>As VP Delivery Management based in Singapore, I contributed to the growth of our business in APAC by building and establishing a strong team which delivered a multitude of solutions. My team successfully managed Digital Competency Centres, effectively managed  Service Level Agreements, and provided a high quality of service and support to all customers in the region. We also supported the Sales and Account Management teams.<br><br>
<br>
<text>This is my value proposition.
<br>
<text>Some of the areas I can support you in, but not limited to, are :
<ul>
<li>projects,
<li>product strategy,
<li>solution design,
<li>business case,
<li>pricing strategy,
<li>digital transformation,
<li>organization changes,
<li>coaching people,
<li>service level agreements.
<br>
<br>
<text>My objective now is to share my knowledge with any IT company, across any industry sector, in addition to the Travel Industry. I will creatively apply my knowledge to find solutions adapted to your business and specific environment.
